fix(critical): Resolve infinite loop and fix prompt generation

This commit addresses two critical bugs:

1.  **Infinite Loop:** The main data loading `useEffect` in `App.tsx` was incorrectly re-triggering on state changes, causing a save/load infinite loop. The dependency array has been corrected to ensure it runs only once on mount, resolving the stability issue.

2.  **Prompt Generation Failure:** The context-aware logic (passing `previousSceneDescription`) was missing from the `generatePrompt` call chain. This caused prompts to be generated without character continuity, failing to include references. The logic has been added to `App.tsx`, `geminiService.ts`, and `api/generate-prompt.ts`, mirroring the `generateIllustration` implementation and ensuring consistent, correct prompt generation.
