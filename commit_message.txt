fix(critical): Correct argument order in generatePrompt call

This commit resolves the persistent 500 server error by fixing a critical argument mismatch in the `generatePrompt` function call within `App.tsx`.

The root cause was a missing `previousSceneDescription` argument. This caused a positional shift in all subsequent arguments, most critically sending the `artStyleDescription` (a string) in place of the `backgrounds` (an array) parameter to the API.

The API server would then crash with a `TypeError: .filter is not a function` because it received a string instead of an array.

This fix corrects the argument order, ensuring the API receives the correct data types and preventing the crash. This should restore full functionality to the prompt generation feature.
