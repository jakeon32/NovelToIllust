feat(continuity): Implement context-aware scene generation

This commit introduces a major improvement to address character continuity issues between scenes.

- The `generateIllustration` API now accepts a `previousSceneDescription` parameter to provide context from the immediately preceding scene.
- A new "CONTEXT FROM PREVIOUS SCENE" section is added to the main prompt, explicitly showing the AI what just happened.
- A `CONTINUITY RULE` has been added to the prompt, instructing the AI to keep characters present if the location has not changed.
- The character filtering logic has been updated to automatically include characters from the previous scene if the location is the same, ensuring they are not forgotten.

This creates a much more robust system that understands the narrative flow and prevents characters from unnaturally disappearing between related moments.
