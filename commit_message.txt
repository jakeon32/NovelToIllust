fix(prompt): Remove fallback logic and improve reference filtering

- Removes the fallback logic in `generate-illustration.ts` and `generate-prompt.ts` that caused all characters and backgrounds to be included in the prompt if no specific match was found.
- Improves the background filtering to prioritize the structured `location` field over a simple text search, increasing accuracy.
- Adds an `age` check to the final prompt checklist to improve character consistency.
