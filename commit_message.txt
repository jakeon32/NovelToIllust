fix(filtering): Make character name matching more robust

This commit fixes a subtle bug where character references were not being included in prompts.

The root cause was that the scene generation AI would sometimes add parenthetical translations to character names (e.g., "에린 (Erin)"). The filtering logic was performing a strict equality check against the character name ("에린"), which would fail.

The matching logic in both `generate-illustration.ts` and `generate-prompt.ts` has been changed from `includes()` to `startsWith()`. This makes the matching more resilient to these kinds of minor variations from the AI, ensuring that the correct character references are found and included.
