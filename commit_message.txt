refactor(scenes): Strengthen prompt for character name preservation

This change addresses the root cause of character inconsistency by adding a critical, explicit directive to the `generate-scenes` prompt.

The new prompt mandates that the AI must preserve the exact proper nouns of characters and locations from the source text, preventing them from being summarized into generic descriptions like "a girl" or "a hall". This ensures that the downstream filtering logic in `generate-illustration` can correctly identify and use the appropriate character and background references.
