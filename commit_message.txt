chore(debug): Add hyper-detailed comparison logging

This is a diagnostic commit to find the root cause of the character filtering failure.

Previous attempts to fix the logic have failed. This version adds detailed logging to the character filter loop, printing the exact two strings being compared in every `startsWith` check.

This will provide the ground-truth data needed to finally understand why the filtering is failing.
