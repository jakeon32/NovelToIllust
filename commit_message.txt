fix(logic): Implement bidirectional character name matching

This commit resolves the regression where character references were not being included in generated prompts.

The root cause was a flawed, one-way `startsWith` check for character names. This failed when the AI-provided name was less specific than the user-registered name (e.g., AI: "Erin", User: "Erin (Official)").

The filtering logic in both `api/generate-prompt.ts` and `api/generate-illustration.ts` has been updated to be bidirectional, checking if `A.startsWith(B)` or `B.startsWith(A)`. This ensures a match regardless of which name is more specific.

Additionally, `.trim()` has been added to all name comparisons to prevent whitespace issues. This finally resolves the character filtering problem.
