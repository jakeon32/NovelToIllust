fix(prompt): Pass structuredDescription to generatePrompt API

This commit fixes a bug where the 'Generate Image' button for a single scene would produce a prompt without character/background references.

The `generatePrompt` API call was missing the `structuredDescription` parameter, causing the server-side filtering logic to fail and fall back to a less reliable method.

This change ensures that the detailed structured data is always passed, aligning the behavior of the single-scene prompt generation with the main illustration generation and resolving the inconsistency.
