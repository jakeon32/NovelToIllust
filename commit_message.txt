feat(scenes): Implement character continuity logic

This introduces a post-processing step after scene generation to ensure character continuity.

- When scenes are generated, the app now iterates through them and keeps track of which characters are present in a given location.
- If a character appears in a scene, they are automatically carried over to subsequent scenes in the same location, even if not explicitly mentioned in that specific moment of the text.
- This prevents characters from unnaturally disappearing and reappearing, improving the logical flow and consistency of the generated scenes.
