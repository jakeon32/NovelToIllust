fix(critical): Revert frontend changes and fix API crash

This commit reverts the incorrect frontend changes from the previous commit and fixes the actual root cause of the 500 error, which was a server-side crash.

- Reverted the `useEffect` dependency change in `App.tsx`. The original logic was correct, and the change was based on a misinterpretation of the error log.
- Fixed a `TypeError` in `api/generate-prompt.ts`. The code did not safely handle cases where `sceneDescription` could be null, causing the regex `.test()` method to crash the API. Added a `typeof sceneDescription === 'string'` check to prevent this.
